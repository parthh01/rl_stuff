Objective: 
on policy actor-critic method to control humanoid joints via torque on motors 
with deterministic policy gradient for the actor and 
huber loss(reward - critic value) for the critic


single network with actor-critic synchronous output will need custom network class built on tf.nn 
backpropagation for actor in separate actor critic networks will need custom loss function 

tensorflow's implementation of an actor critic method is wack but it's the most supported one there is so
