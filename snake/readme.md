the plan was to try DQN and some other rl policies on some snake game, but I couldn't find a good working one online (idk how) so I just decided to apply this on the first low state action space game I could find on pygame trending. Found this 'Stonks' game which appears to generate price movements in a fairly good enough representation of a geometric random walk/brownian motion or whatever other phenomena people believe stock movements resemble. I like that it has the added dimension of applying for loans and so the theory it'll be interesting to see what, if at all, startegy an agent can learn.
